# Alziemers-classification-mini1

Our project centers around developing an advanced machine learning model for accurately classifying different stages of Alzheimer's Disease from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Leveraging the power of the Keras and Scikit libraries in Jupyter Notebook, we achieved outstanding optimization through the innovative Artificial Bee Colony algorithm.

In data preprocessing, performed data balancing and data augmentation. Subsequently, trained our proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture on the processed data. To optimize the model's performance, we conducted hyperparameter tuning for essential parameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs, using the innovative Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. This comprehensive approach allowed us to achieve remarkable results in our multi-label classification task for Alzheimer's Disease stages from MRI images.

Furthermore, we've made the model accessible and user-friendly by creating an intuitive GUI with Flask framework, facilitating seamless deployment and interaction. Our endeavor aims to contribute significantly to the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease, ultimately making a positive impact on healthcare and patient outcomes.
